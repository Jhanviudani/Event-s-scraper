It all started with a running club for local founders and tech enthusiasts, where folks would stay for coffee afterwards. Overtime, some people came just for the coffee. One morning, someone said, “We should just make this a thing.”
The idea is to create a forum for people who are interested in technology and, perhaps more importantly, want to build technology companies. Successful ventures require a health mix of people with skills and experiences in many areas, and there are not many open spaces for like-minded people to chat without an itinerary or program.
And so, a LinkedIn post would go out every Wednesday, announcing a coffee shop that the meet up would take place. On Friday, those who are interested would show up to this rotating location. The attendees vary, but the conversation was always energizing. They shared startup experiences, traded advice on hiring and fundraising, and even found ways to collaborate.
As the group grows, the rotating format is taking a break. Currently, we meet at the patio in Bakery Square every Friday from 8am-10am.
