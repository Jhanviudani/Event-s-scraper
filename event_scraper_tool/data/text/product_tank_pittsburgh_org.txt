Keeping Humans at the Heart of AI Products
icon
Avenu: Oakland, Pittsburgh, PA
Hey there, ProductTank Pittsburgh! We are excited to see you again and hear all about your summer as we return to our in-person programming with this September meetup.
In this talk, we will explore how to build AI products that truly serve human needs by delving into the AI product life cycle, from ideation to deployment. We will discuss critical aspects of AI productization, including data, model selection, and continuous improvement, while emphasising human-centric design principles to ensure usability, trust, and impact. Through real-world case studies, we will highlight successes and pitfalls of AI integration in products. Finally, we will introduce practical AI tools that can empower product people to make informed decisions, streamline workflows, and enhance human value in every stage of AI-driven product development.
Agenda:
5:30-6:00 - arrival & networking
6:00-7:00 - speaker
7:00-7:30 - networking & farewell
