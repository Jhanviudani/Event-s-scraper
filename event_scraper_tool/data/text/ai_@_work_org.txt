About us
For builders,
by builders
‚ÄãOur mission is to
make Pittsburgh the leading city for the practical business application of artificial intelligence by providing an open space to connect, share, and build.
With AI models and tools evolving at a breakneck pace, this community is where builders swap stories, share battle scars, and trade tips for what's working in AI and, almost as importantly, what is not.
Events
Rad, impactful meetups
Once every two months the community gets together at the Tech Forge in Lawrenceville. Here's what to expect at each:
First and foremost, demos. Lots of demos.
‚ÄãInteractive, roundtable discussions on AI news
‚ÄãAn implied ‚ÄúfrieNDA‚Äù policy
