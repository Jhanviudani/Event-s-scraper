During routine penetration testing research, Cam uncovered that a coercion attack unexpectedly succeeded in dumping the SAM hive, despite protections believed to have been in place since 2008.\nIn this session, Cam will walk us through the technical journey from discovery to weaponization, revealing how the exploit combines DNS manipulation, coercion techniques like PetitPotam, and Kerberos relay attacks to gain SYSTEM-level access on domain controllers and member servers. He will also cover how organizations can detect this type of activity in their environments and what steps they can take to remediate and harden their systems against similar attacks. This talk is a powerful reminder of the importance of investigating unexpected test results and how they can lead to critical security breakthroughs.\nA special thank you to GuidePoint Security for sponsoring this month’s Pittsburgh ISSA meeting and supporting our local cybersecurity community.\n**Cam Stish:** began his career in the security industry in 2016.

August 19, 2025**\nJoin the Pittsburgh Chapter of ISSA and guest speaker [Cam Stish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-stish/)\nMeeting Refreshments Sponsored by [Guidepoint Security](https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/)\n**Schedule of Events:**\n**5:00pm -** Light refreshments.\n**5:15pm -** Chapter Board and Partner Introduction\n**5:30pm -** Interactive Discussion\n**6:30pm -** Adjourn for social hour\n\nPlease **RSVP** by noon on Sunday, August 17th, 2025\n\nJoin us for an eye-opening presentation from Cam Stish of GuidePoint Security as he shares the accidental discovery of CVE-2025-33073, a critical Kerberos Reflection vulnerability that enables attackers to bypass authentication in Active Directory environments. During routine penetration testing research, Cam uncovered that a coercion attack unexpectedly succeeded in dumping the SAM hive, despite protections believed to have been in place since 2008.\nIn this session, Cam will walk us through the technical journey from discovery to weaponization, revealing how the exploit combines DNS manipulation, coercion techniques like PetitPotam, and Kerberos relay attacks to gain SYSTEM-level access on domain controllers and member servers. He will also cover how organizations can detect this type of activity in their environments and what steps they can take to remediate and harden their systems against similar attacks. This talk is a powerful reminder of the importance of investigating unexpected test results and how they can lead to critical security breakthroughs.\nA special thank you to GuidePoint Security for sponsoring this month’s Pittsburgh ISSA meeting and supporting our local cybersecurity community.\n**Cam Stish:** began his career in the security industry in 2016. His professional experience includes security assessments, specializing in network, wireless, and application penetration testing. He has led and participated in vulnerability assessments and penetration testing throughout the world for industries such as banking, commercial, e-commerce, manufacturing, and many other industries.

Attendees are encouraged to bring used one used hand tool under 12\" that is either need of repair or determination of its continued usefulness and integrity. If you are unsure if a tool is appropriate for this class, please contact us via the email address at the bottom of this class description.\n\nShould attendees bring an item to be repaired, steel for wedges and a small selection of wood types will be provided for fabricating new handles. Possible species include include ash, hickory, beech, mahogany, white limba, and others. The proper wood choice is dependent on the item being repaired, and the instructor will help guide students through the process!\n\n**Don't have a tool to bring?** No problem. We have a few things in need of repair, plus several ball pein hammers that can be used for practice. Whatever the choice, the student will take something home at the end of class.\n\n**Be advised:** Not all damages will be or can be fixed during this class, nor is this a course on complete restoration of old tools.\n\n**Requirements:** No experience required. Must be 16 or older; minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. As this is the first class, any feedback for the instructor and organization would be appreciated after the class session.\n\n**Safety requirements**: No open-toed or cloth shoes. Long hair should be tied back, and dangling jewelry should be removed. Any necessary PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) such as eye and ear protection will be provided.\n\n**Date \u0026 Time:** Saturday, August 23rd from 10:30am-2:30pm\nBen will be available after class is finished. Please note that we are trying to work out how long to make future sessions.\n\n**Office hours:** Students can return to HackPGH for an optional weekend appointment if further work is necessary - by appointment only!\n\n**Breaks:** Several breaks will be taken throughout the class. Bottled water, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are available for free from our coffee bar. Light snacks will be provided for the breaks during this class session. Other snacks and drinks can be purchased from our vending machines.\n\n**Cost:** $75 ($70 for HackPGH members) - discounted cost for this first-ever session.\n\n* [YOU MUST REGISTER AND PAY USING THIS LINK!](https://members.hackpgh.org/event-6275216)\n* Payment is due at registration to save your spot in the class!\n* If you plan to pay with cash, you must contact us at the email below to make payment arrangements.
